= Artic Kiwi

Artic Kiwi is a really cool issue tracker written in Ruby for the sole purpose of having fun.  Maybe later I'll add important features, like collision-detection to guids and commands, and more interesting usage. Developed mostly for internal/small-team use.

Run `kiwi` for help.

The issues can be tracked by allowing your source control to track the `.kiwi` folder of your project.
